  As a motivated junior software engineer, Iâ€™ve gained over a year of hands-on experience utilizing various full-stack technologies at an innovative startup. Proficient with JavaScript Golang, Next.js, Tailwind CSS and databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB, I approach each project with a dedication to clean and efficient coding practices.
  Whether optimizing site performance, collaborating on new feature launches, or mentoring fellow engineers, I ensure tasks are completed thoroughly and on schedule. Independent and intentional learning also plays a key role in my continual skills progression. My passion lies in using software for humanitarian purposes down the road, with a focus on fields like green initiatives, inclusive development or population welfare advances through technological means.
  This drive, paired with strengths in problem-solving, communication and delivering high-quality work, makes me well-suited for collaborative teams tackling ambitious challenges. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how an organization creating purpose-driven products could benefit from a team player committed to technical excellence and personal growth. Please feel free to connect if you see alignment with your mission and needs.
